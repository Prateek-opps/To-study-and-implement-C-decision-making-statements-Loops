# C++ Programs Collection

This repository includes various beginner-level C++ programs demonstrating control structures like loops, conditionals, and user input/output formatting. The goal is to understand the basic syntax and logic building in C++.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Program 1: Print Numbers 1 to 20
**File:** `print_1_to_20.cpp`

### ðŸ“Œ Algorithm:
1. Initialize `i = 0`.
2. Use a `while` loop while `i < 20`.
3. Print `i+1` and then increment `i`.
4. Print newline after each number.

### âœ… Conclusion:
Demonstrates basic use of a `while` loop and output in C++.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Program 2: Number Triangle
**File:** `number_triangle.cpp`

### ðŸ“Œ Algorithm:
1. Take number of rows as input.
2. Use nested `for` loops to print incrementing numbers in triangle form.

### âœ… Conclusion:
Great for learning nested loops and pattern printing using counters.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Program 3: Diamond Pattern of Stars
**File:** `diamond_pattern.cpp`

### ðŸ“Œ Algorithm:
1. Use a `for` loop to print the upper half.
2. Use nested loops for spaces and stars.
3. Repeat in reverse for the lower half.

### âœ… Conclusion:
Demonstrates symmetry, nested loops, and logic in formatting patterns.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Program 4: Right-Angled Triangle of Stars
**File:** `right_triangle.cpp`

### ðŸ“Œ Algorithm:
1. Loop from `1` to `n`.
2. For each row, print increasing number of stars.

### âœ… Conclusion:
Introduces nested loops and basic pattern creation.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Program 5: Nested Loop (Outer/Inner)
**File:** `nested_loops.cpp`

### ðŸ“Œ Algorithm:
1. Outer loop from `1` to `2`.
2. Inner loop from `1` to `3`.
3. Print each iteration.

### âœ… Conclusion:
Illustrates the concept of nested loops clearly.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Program 6: Right-Aligned Star Triangle
**File:** `right_aligned_triangle.cpp`

### ðŸ“Œ Algorithm:
1. Outer loop controls rows.
2. Inner loops for spaces and stars.
3. Right-align each row using spaces.

### âœ… Conclusion:
Enhances understanding of output formatting using loops.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Program 7: Even Numbers from 0 to 10
**File:** `even_numbers.cpp`

### ðŸ“Œ Algorithm:
1. Loop from `0` to `10`.
2. Use `if` condition to check for even numbers.
3. Print them.

### âœ… Conclusion:
Simple demonstration of conditional logic inside a loop.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Program 8: Password Authentication
**File:** `password_checker.cpp`

### ðŸ“Œ Algorithm:
1. Set a fixed password.
2. Use `while` loop for 3 attempts.
3. If correct, unlock system; else show error.

### âœ… Conclusion:
Practices conditional statements and loop control using user input.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Program 9: Reverse a Number
**File:** `reverse_number.cpp`

### ðŸ“Œ Algorithm:
1. Extract digits using `% 10`.
2. Build reversed number.
3. Use `/ 10` to remove digits.

### âœ… Conclusion:
Shows how to manipulate and reverse integers using math.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Program 10: Print "SIT" 6 Times
**File:** `print_SIT.cpp`

### ðŸ“Œ Algorithm:
1. Loop from `0` to `5`.
2. Print "SIT" in each iteration.

### âœ… Conclusion:
Simple demonstration of using a loop to repeat output.

## ðŸ”š Final Thoughts

These programs cover:
- Loops (for, while)
- Nested structures
- Conditional logic
- Pattern printing
- Basic input/output

They serve as a strong foundation for beginner programmers in C++ to understand how control structures work and how to build simple yet useful applications.
